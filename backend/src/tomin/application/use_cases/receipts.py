"""Ingesting a photographed ticket, and pointing it at the right movement.

The mirror of ``process_file.py`` for the other half of a purchase. A statement
says *what left the account*; a ticket says *what came home*. This module takes
the lines a phone read off a photo it kept, turns them into products with
comparable prices, and attaches them to the movement they explain.

Everything here is written for the case where the attachment is uncertain,
because it usually is. A receipt whose movement has not been uploaded yet, two
identical charges on the same day, a total the camera read as ``141.6O`` — all
of these end with the ticket stored and unattached, and a question for the
user. None of them end with a guess.
