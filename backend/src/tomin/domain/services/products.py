"""Turning a printed product name into something two tickets can be compared by.

A thermal printer has ~22 characters and no vowels to spare, so the same milk
is ``LECHE LALA ENT 1L`` at one store, ``LALA LECHE ENTERA 1 LT`` at another and
``7501020510010 LECHE LALA`` at a third. Comparing prices means deciding when
two of those are the same thing, and that decision is made *here*, once, so the
ingest that stores ``product_key`` and the comparison that groups on it can
never drift apart.

The rules are deliberately dumb and legible:

1. fold to the same normalisation the rest of the domain already uses
   (``categorization.normalize``: lowercase, no accents, no punctuation),
2. drop the store's own numbers — barcodes, PLU codes, line codes,
3. lift the size out of the name into a real quantity (``600 ml`` -> 0.6 l),
   because size is a *price* fact, not part of the product's identity,
4. expand the handful of abbreviations a Mexican ticket actually uses,
5. drop filler words that carry no identity (``pza``, ``c/u``, ``bolsa``).

What is *not* here: fuzzy matching, edit distance, embeddings. Two names that
survive this and still differ are treated as different products, and the user
sees them as separate rows. That is a visible, correctable outcome; a fuzzy
match that silently merges "leche entera" with "leche deslactosada" is a wrong
number presented as a fact, which this product does not do anywhere else.
