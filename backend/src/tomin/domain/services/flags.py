"""Derived flags read off a bank description (docs/redesign-plan.md §2, §3).

Two facts about a movement that no statement states outright and that both
change headline numbers:

**Is it a transfer between the user's own accounts?** A "PAGO TC" on the debit
statement is the same money as the card's own charges, so counting both doubles
it. `is_transfer` is excluded by default from every spend measure.

**Is it cash coming out of an ATM?** Metric 4. The plan is explicit that this
must be a *flag*, not a category keyword: a withdrawal's category is unknown --
the money was spent on something the statement cannot see.

Both are **conservative on purpose**, and in opposite ways.

*Transfers* match only explicit card-payment / traspaso wording. A plain
"TRANSFERENCIA" or "SPEI" to a third party is rent, or a friend, or a
contractor -- real money leaving. Treating those as transfers would silently
delete a large share of someone's spending, which is a worse failure than
leaving a card payment double-counted, because it is invisible.

*Withdrawals* exclude fees. "COMISION RETIRO" is what the bank charged you for
the withdrawal; it is not cash in your pocket, and metric 4 claims to say how
much cash you took out (§3: "Split out `comision retiro` — the fee isn't
withdrawn cash").

Pure domain: a string in, two booleans out. No repository, no I/O -- same shape
as ``categorization.py``.
