"""Recurring-charge detection: subscriptions, fixed bills, payroll deductions.

Every rule here is explainable, because every surfaced series makes a claim
about the user's future money ("Netflix vuelve a cobrar el día 5"). Precision
over recall — the same rule as the advisor and anomaly detection: one wrong
"recurring" and the tab reads as noise.

The gates, in order:
- **Grouping** is by normalized description with digit-heavy tokens stripped,
  so "OXXO SUC 4412" and "OXXO SUC 8891" collapse into one series and a folio
  number can't split a subscription into singletons.
- **A name the user typed on two or more charges is stronger than the bank
  text.** SPEI strings bury the month in the body ("SECUNDARIA JULIO"); the
  heuristic then splits "Colegiatura Demian" into one-charge groups. If the
  user already said they are the same thing, that is the series.
- **Three occurrences minimum.** Two is a coincidence.
- **Known Mexican utilities** (CFE) collapse to one identity even when the
  product line changes (SUM SERV → CONTIGO). CFE residential is bimonthly.
- **Cadence must be regular**: the *median* interval (robust to one late
  charge) classifies the frequency, and most gaps must sit near it. A
  merchant you merely visit often has no rhythm and is not a subscription.
