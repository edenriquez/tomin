"""Declarative vocabulary for the metric registry (docs/redesign-plan.md §1).

Pure domain: no SQL, no Flask, no DuckDB. A :class:`MetricSpec` says *what* a
metric means -- which measures it selects, which dimensions and filters a client
may combine with it, what shape comes back -- in **semantic** names only. The
name-to-column mapping belongs to the adapter
(``adapters/outbound/cube/duckdb_metric_engine.py``), which is what keeps the
catalog a business definition rather than a query template.

The catalog is *closed*: a client sends a metric id plus identifiers drawn from
this vocabulary and never an expression. Everything outside it is rejected here,
before a compiler ever sees it.
