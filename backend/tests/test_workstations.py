"""Workstations: CRUD, and the one property that matters more than CRUD.

That property is **a rule is only saveable if it is queryable** -- the same
guarantee `test_dashboards.py` holds for layouts. It matters more here: a widget
that cannot render is one broken card, while a rule that cannot compile is a
whole view whose every number is missing, with nothing on screen to say why.

So most of this file is about what the endpoint *refuses*.
