"""Re-derive transfer/withdrawal flags: the vocabulary grew (Nu wording).

0008 backfilled the flags with the rule as it stood; the rule has since
learned "su abono" (a card statement acknowledging the payment you made into
it) and "cajita" (Nu's own savings pocket), and learned that a transfer is
never a cash withdrawal. Every stored row must mean the same thing as a row
ingested today, so the whole ledger is re-run through the shared rule —
same reasoning as 0008: the flags are a *classification*, re-derivable from
the description at any time, and one shared implementation in
``domain/services/flags.py`` is the property worth protecting.

Re-flags in BOTH directions (sets and clears), unlike 0008's set-only pass:
this migration's whole point is that some old answers were wrong.

The cube is not touched here — it is derived state; rebuild it
(``POST /api/admin/cube/rebuild``) after upgrading, or the next upload's
rows will disagree with the old ones.
