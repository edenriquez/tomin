"""Transfer + cash-withdrawal flags, with a data backfill (B7).

Metrics 4 and 9, and every other number gets more correct (§7). Two derived
booleans on ``transactions``, plus a backfill so existing history means the same
thing as anything uploaded after this.

**Why the backfill imports the domain rule instead of inlining SQL LIKEs.**
Freezing a copy of the heuristic in this file is the usual migration
discipline, and it is wrong here. These flags are a *classification*: if the
backfill classifies "PAGO TC BBVA" differently from ingest, the database ends
up in a state where the same description means two different things depending
on when it was uploaded, and no later rebuild can tell which rows are which.
One shared rule in ``domain/services/flags.py`` is the property worth
protecting; a stale-migration replay is not, because the flags are re-derivable
from the description at any time.

Row-by-row Python is affordable at this scale (a personal-finance history is
thousands of rows, not billions) and it is the only way to run exactly the
ingest rule, accent folding and fee exclusion included.

The cube is **not** touched. It is derived state and `rebuild_for_user` is the
supported way to pick these columns up (§7, B2) -- which is the whole reason the
cube was made disposable before this step.

Adds no table, so no new RLS policy: ``transactions`` is already covered by 0003.
