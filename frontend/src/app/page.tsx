/**
 * The switch at the root. Two states, one URL:
 * - no data → the Onboarding (the dropzone + OCR review). The pitch lives on
 *   the standalone landing (`landing/`), which is where visitors arrive from;
 *   repeating it here made a convinced visitor read it twice;
 * - has data → the app shell.
 *
 * Which state shows is a claim about the user's data, so it is only ever made
 * from a successful probe:
 * - the probe is year-wide, not window-wide, so the answer doesn't flip when
 *   a narrower window happens to be empty;
 * - a probe *error* falls through to the app, which says "backend
 *   unreachable" per view. Telling a user with three years of statements to
 *   upload their first one is the worse failure.

 * grey beat the probe already shows, so the handoff is invisible.
