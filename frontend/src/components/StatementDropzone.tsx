/**
 * Upload statements as a hook, so the dropzone, the archive and the header

 * queue, same completion callbacks.
 *
 * **Many files, one at a time.** The picker and the drop target both take a
 * whole selection, and the queue walks it sequentially rather than firing
 * every request at once. Three reasons, in order of how much they matter:
 * the slow half of an upload is the backend parsing a PDF, so five concurrent
 * requests finish no sooner and are likelier to time out; the password dialog
 * is modal, and two files asking at the same time have nowhere to ask; and a
 * queue that advances one row at a time is legible — you can see which file
 * is being read right now.
 *
 * **A rejected file is a row, not a toast.** With one file a toast could say
 * "that was a .docx". With six it cannot say *which*, so every outcome —
 * wrong extension included — lands on the file's own row and stays there
 * until it is dismissed.
 *
 * The extension is checked before the request goes out, and an encrypted PDF
 * is sniffed locally: learning "that was a .docx" or "this needs a password"
 * should not cost a round trip.
