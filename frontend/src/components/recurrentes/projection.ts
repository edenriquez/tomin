/**
 * What the selected series have cost, month by month, and what they will cost.
 *
 * Two different kinds of number live here and they must not be confused:
 *
 * - **History** is measured. Each past month is the sum of the charges that
 *   actually landed in it.
 * - **Projection** is simulated, charge by charge: step the cadence forward
 *   from `next_expected` and drop `typical_amount` on each landing. This is
 *   deliberately NOT `monthly_equivalent × months` — a rate times a duration
 *   smears an annual charge across twelve months, which answers "what is my
 *   average" when the user asked "what will I pay". An annual renewal in
 *   November either falls inside your six-month horizon or it doesn't, and
 *   the whole point of asking is to find out which.
 *
 * A series whose expected charge is long overdue is treated as ended and is
 * not projected: quietly billing the user for a cancelled subscription is the
 * one error here that compounds.
 *
 * "Overdue" is measured against the END OF THE LEDGER, not against today, and
 * that distinction is the whole difference between this working and not. A
 * user who last uploaded a statement in July has no data for August; judging
 * against today would declare every series cancelled at once and hand back an
 * empty projection. Against the ledger's own last day the question becomes the
 * one that carries evidence: while other charges kept arriving, did THIS one
 * stop? Silence from the whole ledger is a missing statement, not a wave of
 * cancellations.
