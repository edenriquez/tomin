/**
 * The header's search bar. A real input, not a button dressed as one.
 *
 * It used to be a button whose whole job was to open the dialog, and the
 * docstring defended that: "not a search field pretending to be a filter."
 * The dialog is still where results live — a 1200px header has nowhere to put
 * them — but the handover now happens on the first keystroke rather than on a
 * click, so what you typed is the search the dialog opens on. That is the part
 * that was not functional before: you pressed a button and then typed again.
 *
 * Three things the shape has to get right:
 *
 * - **⌘K is a flex sibling, not an overlay.** It sits at the trailing edge and
 *   the input is `flex-1` beside it, so the field's own box ends where the key
 *   begins and typed text can never run underneath it. An absolutely
 *   positioned key would need a hard-coded `pr-*` that goes wrong the moment
 *   the label changes.
 * - **Glass, which means genuinely translucent.** `bg-paper/70` over a blur
 *   rather than an opaque near-white: the bar samples the canvas instead of
 *   covering it.
 * - **It is the tallest thing in the header, on purpose.** `h-11` against the
 *   `h-9` of Pagos and Documentos. An earlier pass argued the opposite — that
 *   matching its siblings was what kept it from reading as a banner — and that
 *   was the right call for a button. This is the way into the ledger, so it
 *   outranks the nav rather than sitting level with it.
 * - **Four properties animate, and none of them is a bevel.** Width, shadow,
 *   glass opacity, hairline. The shadow carries the focus state: `fieldFocus`
 *   adds a 4px halo of the accent that grows out of nothing, which is the
 *   modern version of the job a hard ring does. Easing is expo-out — fast
 *   away from rest, long settle — so the growth reads as motion rather than a
 *   step. Skipped entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion`: a box that changes
 *   size is exactly what that setting is asking us not to do.
 *
 * And focus alone opens nothing, so all of that plays on a bar the user is
 * still looking at rather than behind the dialog — see `handOff`.

    /**
     * The first keystroke opens the dialog, seeded with what was typed, and
     * its own field takes over from there.
     *
     * Deliberately the *keystroke* and not focus or a click. Two reasons, and
     * both are load-bearing:
     *
     * - `useOverlay` restores focus to whatever was focused before the dialog
     *   opened, which is this input. Opening on focus would mean closing the
     *   dialog re-focuses the bar, which reopens the dialog, forever.
     * - The focus animation belongs to a bar that still has focus. If the
     *   dialog took over the moment you arrived, the one thing that was asked
     *   for would play behind an overlay.
     *
     * So focus is quiet: the bar grows and waits. Typing is what commits.
