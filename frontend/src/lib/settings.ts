/**
 * User settings — what the user has chosen, not what they have.
 *
 * Two kinds of preference live here:
 *
 * - **App-wide** (`windows`, `lastWindow`, `editorMode`): things no single
 *   card owns. They stay typed fields; `windows` is edited from the period
 *   row itself in editor mode, `lastWindow` is written as the user navigates.
 * - **Per-panel** (`panels`): each card's own configuration, stored under an
 *   opaque id. This file deliberately does NOT know what a panel's keys mean —
 *   the component declares its defaults and reads them through
 *   `usePanelSettings`, so adding a control never touches this module.
 *
 * The user customizes what shows and which periods exist, never layout.
 *
 * Persistence hides behind `SettingsStore`, async on purpose even though
 * localStorage is sync — when the store becomes a backend endpoint, no
 * caller changes. No React in this file.
